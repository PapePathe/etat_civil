# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
/snadm/.bundle

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/snadm/log/*
/snadm/tmp/*
!/snadm/log/.keep
!/snadm/tmp/.keep

# Ignore pidfiles, but keep the directory.
/snadm/tmp/pids/*
!/snadm/tmp/pids/
!/snadm/tmp/pids/.keep

/snadm/.byebug_history

# Ignore master key for decrypting credentials and more.
/snadm/config/master.key
node_modules/
